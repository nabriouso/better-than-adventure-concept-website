            Minecraft has changed a lot since its initial beta period in 2011.
            The game has grown substantially, and new features, mechanics and
            systems continue to be added even to this day. While this is all
            well and good, there are still players out there who don't enjoy the
            direction the game took post-release, or simply have nostalgia for
            beta minecraft and wish to return to a time without hunger,
            experience or enchantments with a few bells and whistles on. Better
            Than Adventure is designed to appeal to these players who enjoy the
            simpler gameplay of the old beta versions of Minecraft, yet also
            want to try something new and exciting. Think of it as an "alternate
            universe" version of minecraft that attempts to maintain the
            look-and-feel of beta 1.7.3, while also keeping things fresh with
            new features and additions such as new blocks, biomes and quality of
            life improvements. Despite what the name implies, this mod isn't
            necessarily trying to offer something inherently better than modern
            Minecraft, just something different. Think of it as a long-lost
            branch of Minecraft, what could have been if Notch and Jeb took the
            game in a slightly different direction. While BTA is designed mostly
            to appeal to older players who grew up with beta, the aim of the mod
            in general is simply to offer an alterate take on the game. So if
            you're just looking for something new to enjoy, try this mod out
            too. You may like it!

            "Better Than Adventure" (BTA) is an extensive mod for Minecraft beta
            1.7.3, bringing out regular updates attempting to create a more
            "finalized" version of beta Minecraft while also maintaining the
            look and feel of the game pre-adventure update. BTA works very
            different from other mods as it acts as more of a “fork” of
            Minecraft, than an addition to it. As of beta 1.7.6, As such,
            existing mods for beta 1.7.3 are not compatible with BTA. However,
            we are working hard to allow the community to make and publish their
            own mods for BTA specifically.

              Welcome! Better than Adventure is a mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.
              It was originally intended to add a few new features for a
              personalised experience, but has since grown into a full-fledged
              fork of Minecraft, adding dozens of new features for players to
              enjoy. Our philosophy is to add new gameplay that enhances and
              improves on the existing aspects of the game, without drastically
              changing the core experience. The question we like to ask
              ourselves is, "Would Mojang have added this to the vanilla game
              back in 2011?" If the answer is yes, it's probably a good
              candidate for BTA

              The recommended method of playing BTA is via our handy MultiMC
              update utility, which you can find here! To install the utility,
              simply drag and drop that link onto your MultiMC instance list,
              then run it. It'll generate a managed instance of BTA, which you
              can then run to launch the mod. The neat part is, whenever the mod
              releases a new update you can just run the update utility again
              and it'll automatically upgrade your managed instance to the
              latest version! No more messing around with jar files, and all
              your saves, screenshots and settings will be in exactly the same
              place

              Lots of things! We've added so much new stuff to this mod that
              it's honestly impossible to keep track of it all. A good place to
              start if you want to know everything is our update changelogs.
              However, an experience we find a lot of people seem to enjoy is
              just going in blind and discovering new stuff as you play. We're
              always happy to answer any questions you might have on our Discord
              server, so feel free to join and ask! There's also a recipe book
              called the Guidebook built into the game, which is bound to R by
              default. Recipes start blacked out, but progressively reveal
              themselves as you discover the items that comprise them. Don't be
              afraid to experiment!

            <div class="mb-1">
              Thanks for the interest! There's a few ways you can help with BTA:
              firstly, if you're a programmer, feel free to ask us about
              becoming a contributor on our Discord, as we're always eager to
              get new people with different abilities and skillsets involved
              with development. Just be aware that the standards expected are
              pretty high, so we'll need to see some evidence of your ability
              before giving you access.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-1">
              Secondly, if you're a texture artist, stick around! We pretty
              frequently ask the community for new textures, since there's a lot
              of talented people out there who can make far better art than we
              can. Thirdly, post suggestions in suggestion-discussion! We're
              always looking for new ideas to make the mod better. If none of
              those things apply, spread the word! Tell your friends, partners,
              coworkers, or even strangers on the street about BTA. After all,
              the more the merrier!

              Yes and no - BTA is only compatible with mods specifically made
              for it. Most mods you can think of will not work, as a lot of our
              optimizations means we have had to change/rewrite way too much of
              the codebase for anything else to be compatible. This means that
              until someone miraculously ports it over, you won't be able to
              play BTA with Aether, or BTA with Moon Mod, so on and so forth.

              You can! The recipe is just a little different. In BTA, zombies
              drop cloth rather than feathers. The bed recipe requires 2 cloth
              and 1 wool, rather than 3 wool, like below:

            <div class="mb-1">
              Yes, we could if we wanted to, but that's not really our
              philosophy. If there's a feature from a later version we'd like to
              include in BTA, we ask ourselves how we can reinvent that feature
              in a way that still gets us there while also giving players a new
              experience.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-1">
              For example, modern Minecraft features multiple different
              varieties of wooden planks, and so does BTA. However, in BTA ours
              come from giving the player the ability to dye oak planks, which
              gives them a fun new pastel color palette to play with.
